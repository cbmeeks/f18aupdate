Create 99/4A In-System Update Files

Files:

F18AUpdate_CF7.dsk - CF7 disk image for final update program and data files
F18AUpdate.TIDisk - used by assembler for the final object code of the update executable
F18A_update.apf - Win99 assembler project file
F18A_update.a99 - main update source code
F18AUPD - update program as a raw file on a filesystem
F18ABIN - final update program as a raw file on a filesystem
F18AROM - final update data file as a raw file on a filesystem

* Copy .bit (not .bin) from systhesis to firmware update working directory.

* Run CRC.jar and select the .bit file to get CRC data for the update program.
  This will create an assembly file with DATA statements.

* Copy DATA from generated CRC into the updater assembly program at label: FL1CRC

* Change the data at the label FRMVER to match the new version.

* Repeat CRC steps if the data file has changes from the previous update.

* Use TI99Dir to copy the .bit file and DATA file to the file system as TI files:
  - Select the .bit file
  - Tools->Convert PC to TI file
      TI File name: F18ABIN (or F18AROM for the DATA file)
      File Type: INT/FIX
      Record Len: 128
      Text/Data Conversion: Binary (no conversion)

* Assemble the program, copy .obj, F18ABIN, and F18AROM to a Classic99 disk directory.
  Run Classic99 and stop after the CRC test to get the new CRC value.

* Put the CRC value into the program code and reassemble.

* Run in Classic99 data to verify the main update screen appears.  If Classic99 resets
  to the master title screen, the CRC failed.

* Check the new version number.

* Using TI99Dir:
  - Open the CF7 image and delete the old files (F18AROM, F18AUPD, F18ABIN)
  - Copy the new F18AROM, F18AUPD, F18ABIN to the CF7 image, the F18AUPD file will
    come from the F18AUpdate.TIDisk image file.
  - Copy F18AUpdate_CF7.dsk image to a CF7 card
